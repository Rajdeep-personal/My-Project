# My-Project
Business Problem: To build  ML model for predicting the selling price of old cars.
The dataset 'Car_details_v3.csv' having 8128 rows and 13 columns have been used in this project for exploring different insights as well as the model building.
For any new instance of car to this dataset I used KNN(K-Nearest Neighbor Regressor) for determining the number of nearest neighbors in order to predict the selling price of it. Also performed Grid search to improve the score and reduce the Root mean square error .
